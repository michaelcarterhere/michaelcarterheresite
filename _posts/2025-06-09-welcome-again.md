This is post number two for this site. It is satisfying to do it this way instead of with a platform. 
But I will move to back to a platform eventually. 
What I am enjoying about this for the moment is that I am just writing text in a md file and pushing it to GitHub. 
I want to experiment with this for a little bit. 
Like going from a laptop to a typewriter or something.
