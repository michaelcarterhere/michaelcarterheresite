Curbs can be busy places!

I loved visiting the City of Boston.  The history, the food, the leveraging technology to enhance parking and curb usage. The city’s initiative, supported by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s SMART Grant, focuses on:
	•	Digital Mapping: Utilizing AI, 360-degree imaging, and LiDAR to create a comprehensive digital map of curb regulations.
	•	Real-Time Information: Providing residents and businesses with up-to-date parking and loading zone data.
	•	Flexible Management: Enabling adaptive curb use to meet changing needs, from ride-sharing to outdoor dining.

This approach not only improves efficiency but also enhances accessibility and safety for all city users.

I really loved visiting the City of Boston.

The walkability, the history, the energy — it’s a city that feels alive in both tradition and innovation.

They also have several smart city projects on the go. One that caught my attention is focused on curbs. 

Boston is digitally mapping every curb in the city using AI, 360° imaging, and LiDAR.
The goal is to improve curbside usage, from parking to deliveries to public space, and make that data accessible, dynamic, and useful.

It made me wonder:
Is this kind of solution only for big cities? What about cities like Kingston?

We already have some building blocks — like a detailed driveway dataset that could help identify curb interruptions across the city. This could be combined with street-level imagery, computer vision tools, community feedback, city zoning and sidewalk data. 

This combination would make a useful tool for exploring flexible curb use, accessibility upgrades, and more responsive curb design for future mobility.
